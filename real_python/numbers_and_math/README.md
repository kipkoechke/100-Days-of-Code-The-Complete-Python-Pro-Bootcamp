**Integers and Floating-Point
Numbers**

Python has three built-in number data types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex.

**Integers**
An **integer** is a whole number with no decimal places. For example 1 is an integer, but 1.0 isn't.
The name of the integer dta type is *int*, which you can see with the ***type()*** function.

An **integer literal** is an integer value that is written explicitly in your
code
